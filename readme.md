# Simple TypeScript webpack Starter

This is a bare minimum starter kit to get you going with your [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) experiments.

It includes the setup needed to compile your TypeScript code and enable live reloads and nothing else. The goal is to get you as close to File -> New -> write **your** code -> F5 (or whatever your editor of choice does) as possible. **And that's it**. No fancy plugins, no linting, no unit testing... Just start coding in seconds and graduate to a more advanced setup or discard the project when you are done.

## Prerequisites

All you need to get started is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

## Install

Just download the source or clone this repository 

```
git clone git@github.com:vjcspy/simple-typescript-webpack-starter.git .
```

Then install dependencies:
```
npm install or yarn install
```

## Run

```
npm start
```

## Edit

Edit  `src/index.ts` and add other TypeScript files the way you see fit. Edit `src/index.html` to change the HTML used by webpack.

## License

This package is released under [Unlicense](http://unlicense.org) meaning you can do pretty much anything you want with it.

## Contribute

The goal is to keep this as simple as possible, so no features should be added. Having said that, if you feel that something is missing for the basic purpose of TypeScript experimentation, feel free to submit a pull request.
